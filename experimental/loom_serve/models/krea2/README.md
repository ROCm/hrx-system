# Krea 2 Turbo component port

This is a **component port, not an image-serving implementation**. The image
input projection and its official softwatercolor LoRA run through Loom's live
source JIT, queued safetensors loading, command programs, and shared device
ownership. Text conditioning, the remaining DiT layers, denoising, and VAE
decoding are not yet implemented here.

The independent [reference script](reference.py) runs the complete model using
PyTorch and Diffusers. Its images are reference outputs, not Loom outputs. It
also captures actual component tensors so the port can advance against real
values instead of judging correctness from a plausible final image.

## Pinned model inputs

The publisher calls this release **Krea 2**, with Raw and Turbo variants. This
port uses Turbo: eight steps, no classifier-free guidance, and the publisher's
Qwen-Image VAE. Source evidence:

The Hugging Face account must have accepted the publisher's access terms and
authenticated with `hf auth login`. These commands download approximately
36.2 GB into one persistent checkpoint set; they exclude the alternate
Diffusers transformer shards, which would duplicate the main weights.

## Independent numerical reference

Install a PyTorch build supporting the reference GPU in a separate Python
environment. The qualified gfx1151 run used Python 3.14, the AMD
`torch[device-gfx1151]==2.13.0+rocm10.0.0` wheel from
`https://stable.repo.amd.com/rocm/whl-next/`, Transformers 5.10.1, PEFT 0.21.2,
Safetensors 0.8.0, Accelerate 1.15.0, NumPy 2.5.3, Pillow 12.3.0, and
Diffusers at the exact commit above. These are development dependencies;
the native Loom checker does not link or load them.

After installing the matching PyTorch wheel, the remaining environment can be
reproduced with:

```sh
python -m pip install \
  'diffusers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git@8b33bfc04b6b5e8bb58a58e55f68746c1bbee4cd' \
  transformers==5.10.1 peft==0.21.2 safetensors==0.8.0 \
  accelerate==1.15.0 numpy==2.5.3 pillow==12.3.0 einops==0.8.2
krea_reference=/path/to/new-reference-output
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 python -B experimental/loom_serve/models/krea2/reference.py \
  --checkpoint "$krea_weights" --adapter "$krea_adapter" \
  --output "$krea_reference"
```

The output directory must be new. At the default 384x384 size it retains about
110 MiB of images, component tensors, denoising steps, and raw BF16 projection
fixtures. The observed reference GPU allocation peak was approximately
33.4 GiB. That is a PyTorch reference measurement, not Loom's model residency.
Execution deliberately synchronizes for inspection and is not a benchmark.
Use the machine's normal exclusive-run mechanism when sharing a GPU.

The reference fixes initial packed noise rather than relying on matching
independent PRNG implementations. Its precision is explicit: GPU/BF16 text
encoder and DiT, then CPU/F32 Qwen-Image VAE. The selected Diffusers
`from_single_file` path casts all 430 DiT parameters, including norms, to BF16
despite the model class's keep-in-F32 declaration. The adapter loader similarly
casts all 528 F32 file tensors to BF16. The script records actual dtypes.
The CPU decoder provides a repeatable numerical oracle independently of GPU
convolution-library choices; it is not the intended Loom execution placement.

`base.png` and `zero.png` must match exactly; `style.png` must differ. Each
intermediate must be finite, and adapter use must preserve base parameter
storage and version counters. Hooks are attached after adapter injection so
the captured projection includes the adapter, not just its wrapped base layer.

## Run the Loom component

Build through the repository's configured build service, then run on a
qualified AMDGPU execution host with the checkpoint files and source tree:

```sh
build_tools/bin/iree-bazel-build --config=asan \
  //experimental/loom_serve:krea_projection_check
bazel-bin/experimental/loom_serve/krea_projection_check \
  --model=experimental/loom_serve/models/krea2 \
  --weights="$krea_weights/turbo.safetensors" \
  --adapter="$krea_adapter/softwatercolor.safetensors" \
  --input="$krea_reference/initial_latents.bf16" \
  --expected_base="$krea_reference/base-image_projection.bf16" \
  --expected_adapter="$krea_reference/style-image_projection.bf16"
```

The default matrix has 576 input rows, 64 input channels, and 6144 output
channels: 3,538,944 checked output elements per phase. The four phases are
base, zero-strength adapter, strength-one adapter, and base after adapter use.
The complete-array comparison allows one BF16 relative rounding interval plus
a small absolute cancellation floor; zero-strength and retained-base identity
are additionally bitwise checks. The first gfx1151 qualification matched the
reference bit-for-bit in all four phases, without using that tolerance. The
same executable also passed independent 16-row and 32-row specializations
bit-for-bit; a non-tiled 17-row request is rejected before device creation.

`--rows` JIT-specializes a positive multiple of 16. Input/reference files must
contain exactly that many rows. For an independent smaller specialization,
the first 16 rows of each fixture suffice because this projection has no
cross-row operation:

```sh
head -c 2048 "$krea_reference/initial_latents.bf16" > /tmp/krea-input-16.bf16
head -c 196608 "$krea_reference/base-image_projection.bf16" > /tmp/krea-base-16.bf16
head -c 196608 "$krea_reference/style-image_projection.bf16" > /tmp/krea-style-16.bf16
```

Use those three files with the same command and `--rows=16`. No native
executable rebuild is needed to change a source kernel or specialization.

## Source and ownership boundary

[`projection.loom`](projection.loom) owns model names, dimensions, and concrete
wrappers. [`kernels/linear.loom`](kernels/linear.loom) receives dimensions as
explicit SSA operands in templates. The wrappers fix those operands during
JIT specialization; shape scalars are not carried in the device launch ABI.
The WMMA layout contract is GFX11 wave32, including the fused bias epilogue.

The first projection is `X W^T + bias`. F32 checkpoint values round to BF16
before contraction; F32 accumulation and bias addition precede the single
BF16 output rounding. This explicitly models BF16 checkpoint loading. It is
not a claim that F32 and BF16 file bytes are interchangeable, or a decision to
convert every full-model weight on each invocation.

The adapter computes `base + strength * B(A X)` with the reference's BF16
rounding boundaries. Its rank is 32 and alpha/rank is one. Base and adapter
use separate immutable parameter roots and checkpoint loads. The loader reads
only the requested tensors, not the whole 36.2 GB set. Low-rank and delta
workspace comes from command reflection and is allocated once, not per run.
The native checker queues work through the existing execution domain and waits
only for its complete-array observations. Cleanup drains accepted work while
borrowed host payloads remain alive.

The next numerical gate is a real transformer block and its conditioning,
followed by the entire source-JIT denoising and VAE path to a comparable image.
This component does not yet establish a generic model bootstrap, image request
scheduler, full-model weight-preparation strategy, or throughput result.
